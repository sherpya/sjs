make classes for curl (needed ?), zip
rip the error printing stuff from somewhere
implement getlasterror feature
add other stuff from korax
endian/offset64 for functions of file.cpp
document code for doxygen
random from korax need a first value rollup :) - fix unsigned/signed - add float - call with no params
add rmdir + recursive to file.cpp (os depends) maybe also add glob support
clean up zip

grab error from JS_CallFunction

js_curl_progress_handler -> DOUBLE_TO_JSVAL crashes

check all JS_FALSE -> rval undef
